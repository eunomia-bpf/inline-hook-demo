# inline hook demo

Implementing an Inline Hook is feasible, but it might encounter some issues in modern operating systems, as they usually prevent modifications to executing code. In some cases, you might need to disable certain memory protection mechanisms, such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) or Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). Additionally, this technique might face difficulties with modern compiler optimizations, as they might inline functions or otherwise modify the structure of functions. Here are the basic steps to implement an Inline Hook:

1. **Find the Address of the Target Function**: First, you need to find the address in memory of the function you want to hook. You can use the `get_function_addr_elf_no_pie` or `get_function_addr_elf_pie` functions mentioned earlier to obtain this address.

2. **Backup Original Instructions**: As you will modify the beginning of the target function to insert a jump instruction, you first need to backup the original instructions so that you can jump back and execute these overwritten instructions after your hook function completes.

3. **Write the Jump Instruction**: Next, you need to write a jump instruction at the beginning of the target function. This instruction will redirect the program's execution flow to your hook function.

4. **Create Your Hook Function**: Your hook function will replace the beginning part of the target function. It should first execute the code you want to insert, then execute the backed-up original instructions, and finally jump back to the remaining part of the target function.

5. **Modify Memory Permissions**: By default, your program's code segment is read-only to prevent accidental or malicious modification of its own code. Therefore, you need to use the `mprotect` function to change the memory page permissions of the target function to make it writable.

6. **Restore Memory Permissions**: After modifying the target function, you should use the `mprotect` function again to restore the original permissions of the memory page.

Please note that this technique might violate some protection mechanisms of operating systems or hardware, and therefore may not work on all systems or configurations. You should be extra careful when using this technique and ensure you fully understand the potential consequences of your modifications.

## build and run

### for x86

Below is an example of how you can modify your code to perform an inline hook for the `my_function`. This is a simplistic approach and works specifically for this case. This is just an illustrative example. For real-world scenarios, a more complex method would need to be employed, considering thread-safety, re-entrant code, and more.

```c
void inline_hook(void *orig_func, void *hook_func) {
    // Store the original bytes of the function.
    unsigned char orig_bytes[5];
    memcpy(orig_bytes, orig_func, 5);

    // Make the memory page writable.
    mprotect(get_page_addr(orig_func), getpagesize(), PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC);

    // Write a jump instruction at the start of the original function.
    *((unsigned char *)orig_func + 0) = 0xE9; // JMP instruction
    *((void **)((unsigned char *)orig_func + 1)) = (unsigned char *)hook_func - (unsigned char *)orig_func - 5;

    // Make the memory page executable only.
    mprotect(get_page_addr(orig_func), getpagesize(), PROT_READ | PROT_EXEC);
}

```

In this example, `my_function` is the original function that is hooked. `my_hook_function` is the function that gets called instead of `my_function`. The `inline_hook` function performs the actual hook by overwriting the start of `my_function` with a jump (`JMP`) instruction to `my_hook_function`.

When you now call `my_function` in your `main`, `my_hook_function` is called instead.

The main.c file contains an example of hooking function:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <inttypes.h>
#include "hook.h"

// This is the hook function.
void my_hook_function()
{
    printf("Hello from hook!\n");
}

// This is the original function to hook.
void my_function()
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
}

int main()
{

    my_function();

    inline_hook(my_function, my_hook_function);

    // Now calling the function will actually call the hook function.
    my_function();

    remove_hook(my_function);

    // Now calling the function will call the original function.
    my_function();

    return 0;
}
```

Build and run the example for x86.

```console
$ make
$ ./maps
Hello, world!
Hello from hook!
Hello, world!
```

Please note that this code is simplified and makes a few assumptions:

- The functions `my_function` and `my_hook_function` are in the same memory page. If they aren't, the jump offset from `my_function` to `my_hook_function` might not fit in the 4 bytes available in the jump instruction.
- The first 5 bytes of `my_function` can be safely overwritten. If there's a multi-byte instruction that starts within the first 5 bytes but doesn't end before the 6th byte, this will crash.
- The functions `my_function` and `my_hook_function` don't move in memory. If they do (for example, if they're in a shared library that gets unloaded and reloaded at a different address), the jump instruction will jump to the wrong place and likely crash.

```console
$ make
$ ./maps
Hello, world!
Hello from hook!
Hello, world!
```

### for arm32

Note that in ARM32, the Program Counter (PC) is usually 2 instructions ahead, which is why we subtract 8 (2 instructions * 4 bytes/instruction) when calculating the offset. This might differ between different ARM versions or modes (Thumb vs ARM, etc.) so please adjust accordingly to your target's specifics.

Also, you need to increase the SIZE_ORIG_BYTES from 16 to 20 because the minimal branch instruction in ARM is 4 bytes and you're going to replace 5 instructions. This is needed because the branch instruction uses a relative offset and you cannot be sure how far your hook function will be. If your function and hook are within 32MB of each other, you could only replace the first 4 bytes with a branch and wouldn't need to touch the rest.

Remember that manipulating code at runtime can be error-prone and architecture-specific. The code can behave differently based on where it's loaded in memory, how the compiler has optimized it, whether it's running in Thumb or ARM mode, and so on. Always thoroughly test the code in the exact conditions where it will be used.

```console
$ make arm
$ ./maps-arm32
Hello, world!
Hello from hook!
Hello, world!
```

### for arm64

Similar to ARM32, ARM64 uses the ARM instruction set. However, there are differences and specifics to consider for ARM64. For example, the encoding of the branch instruction is different and because of the larger address space, you have to create a trampoline for larger offsets that can't be reached by a single branch instruction. The trampoline should be close to the original function so it can be reached by a branch instruction and from there, it will load the full 64 bit address of the hook function.

```console
$ make arm64
$ ./maps-arm64
Hello, world!
Hello from hook!
Hello, world!
```
